# Order resource

### GET /orders?address={address}

# OHLCV resource

### GET /ohlcv?baseToken={baseToken}&quoteToken={quoteToken}&pairName={pairName}&unit={unit}&duration={duration}&from={from}&to={to}

Retrieve OHLCV data corresponding to a baseToken and a quoteToken.

- {baseToken} is the Ethereum address of a baseToken
- {quoteToken} is the Ethereum address of a quoteToken
- {pairName} is the pair name under the format {baseTokenSymbol}/{quoteTokenSymbol}(eg. "ZRX/WETH"). I believe this parameter is currently required but it's planned to be optional. The idea is for this parameter to be used for verifications purposes and the API to send back an eror if it does not correspond to a baseToken/quoteToken parameters
- {duration} is the duration (in units, see param below) of each candlestick
- {unit} is the unit used to represent the above duration: "min", "hour", "day", "week", "month", "year"
- {from} is the beginning timestamp (number of seconds from 1970/01/01) from which ohlcv data has to be queried
- {to} is the ending timestamp ((number of seconds from 1970/01/01)) until which ohlcv data has to be queried

# Notification resource

### GET /notifications?userAddress={userAddress}&page={page}&perPage={perPage}

Retrieve notifications from database with pagination

- {userAddress} is the Ethereum address of user
- {page} is the page number

### PUT /notifications/{id}

Update status of a notification from UNREAD to READ
